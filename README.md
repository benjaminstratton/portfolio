# My Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio!

Within this project, I have utilized my knowledge and skills within HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a representational portfolio displaying my abilities. My knowledge within Bootstrap grew throughout the process, as I started to tackle the last few sections with its design. Going forward, I would like to update my portfolio with Bootstrap design as well as add a card carousel for the experience section.
